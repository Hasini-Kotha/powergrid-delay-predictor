Powergrid Delay Predictor :
   A Machine Learning project to predict cost and timeline overruns in powergrid projects and identify high-risk hotspots.


Features :

   Predict Cost Overrun
   Predict Time Delays
   Classify Risk Levels (Low, Medium, High)
   Interactive Streamlit Dashboar
   SHAP Explainability for model insights


Installation :

    Clone this repository and install dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/Hasini-Kotha/powergrid-delay-predictor.git
cd powergrid-delay-predictor
pip install -r requirements.txt

▶️ Usage :
    Run the Streamlit app:  streamlit run app.py

Technologies Used : 
   Python 
   Streamlit 
   Pandas, NumPy 
   Scikit-learn 
   SHAP (for explainability) 

Future Work : 

   Improve accuracy with XGBoost/LightGBM
   Add visual risk maps for regions
